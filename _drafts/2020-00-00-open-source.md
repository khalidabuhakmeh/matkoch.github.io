@ctrlshifti: lukewarm take: it's fucked up that huge companies like Microsoft use open source software in their projects and don't even buy support licenses

@EmilyKager: I joke a lot about working in open source but really it's great. The best part for me is probably that I don't even HAVE to have some buried imposter syndrome because the users will tell us how much we suck every day ðŸ’«

@wastaz: Im thinking about things like the recent WinGet debacle and how it would have been nice to see @dotnetfdn
 take a larger space in denouncing microsofts actions publically, even if it wasnt _directly_ a dotnet-question.

@hhariri: Microsoft is a business and this idea of "MS loves OSS" serves so far as it can benefit the business. If it can compete with OSS it will. There is no "new MS". There's the MS that realised they need to use OSS as marketing because they pivoted to cloud 1/3

@gortok: If the @dotnetfdn doesnâ€™t stand up for open source authors using .NET, then they arenâ€™t really supporting OSS, are they.

@gortok
To make an ecosystem, @Microsoft and @dotnetfdn will have to stop extinguishing competition and embracing it. The AppGet / WinGet debacle is one such occurrence. Jetbrains Rider is lesser known, but I'd put it in the same neighborhood.

Despite Microsoftâ€˜s well-intention OSS efforts, .NET is and always will be an enterprise framework with absolute Microsoft domination.

@TheCodeJunkie
Oh and to be even more clear - the .net OSS ecosystem was a huge part of what stopped making it fun for me. It's a complicated topic and I think most have thier own idea of what that means to themselves. Wouldn't change a day of it though

@serialseb: Microsoft is actively destroying .net opens-source communities it does not control in impunity. That trend has accelerated in recent times. No one's stopping it, most of us are now bystanders of this slaughter, and it will get worse. Don't talk to me about fâ€™inâ€™dations right now.
