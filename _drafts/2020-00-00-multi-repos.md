Some time ago, the dotnet team announced that they'll [consolidate .NET repositories](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119) hosted on GitHub.

dotnet/coreclr + dotnet/corefx -> dotnet/platform
dotnet/toolset + dotnet/sdk -> dotnet/cli

Other examples: github.com/reactiveui - github.com/nuke-build - github.com/avalonia

What do they have in common?

Working with multiple repositories for a single (big) project is a common technique 

Problem: You're working on a multi-repository project. Each of the repositories can release NuGet packages on its own. However, those repositories also define dependencies between each other â€“ read core and leaf projects. In such cases, it's hard to keep an overview, not even to mention doing cross-repository refactorings. In this blog post we'll look at a few options how to effectively work with such architectures.


[Why not to use them?](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/119)
- **Avoiding confusion.** The more repositories exist, the more possible places a user has to raise issues. Many times, issues will end up in the wrong repository.
- **Pull-requests across repositories.** New features or even bug fixes can require changes in multiple repositories. Synchronizing when PRs get merged or rejected can be really difficult.
- **Inconsistencies and duplicated efforts.** It's not always clear, which parts of our code should be shared and how. This applies to areas like CI/CD and other infrastructure, but also to smaller utility functions.

**So the trend is not to use multiple repositories?** you might ask. If the .NET team decided to merge them into one, maybe it wasn't a good idea after all? The answer can be found in the FAQ section of the announcement: 

![It Depends!](/assets/images/2019-12-12-multi-repository-projects/it-depends.jpg){:height="350px" style="float: right"}
> **Does this mean there will be a single repo for all of .NET?**<br />
> No. We will be reducing the number of repos that contribute to .NET, but currently we do not believe that going all the way down to one is the right answer.

So generally speaking and actually as quite often in software engineering, there is no strict _DO_ or _DO NOT_. It always depends on the particular circumstances, like requirements, the ecosystem in general, and involved parties.

## Why to use them

So we've covered why they shouldn't be used. Let's look at the other side of the medal:

- **Isolated work:** having clear boundaries can also mean to have more guidance and that there are less places to search for something.
- **Separate changelog:** from release management perspective, having a dedicated changelog per sub-project is much more discoverable. We can immediately see how a project was affected (or if at all) in different versions. Global changelogs could use sections indeed, but I still see this as less convenient.
- **Release cycles:** some parts of our product might require different release cycles. For instance, support for a particular third-party platform, like mobile operating systems, could require us to adapt to that.
- **Versioning:** with different release cycles, it's reasonable to have a different versioning strategy. For instance, when writing extensions for Rider or Visual Studio, we could align with their major version number to

## Generating Global Solutions

A first good step to tame multi-repository projects, is to create one solution that contains the complete code from all the repositories of interest. If we have a single solution, we can at least use _Find_ and _Find and Replace_ on a global level to either find or update information.

![One to rule them all](/assets/images/2019-12-12-multi-repository-projects/rule-them-all.jpg){:height="250px"}

From my point of view, a global solution can be generated in two different ways:
- If all repositories are **equally important**, we can create a new _umbrella_ repository that contains the global solution. Practically, we could 
- If there is a **main repository**, we can choose to generate the global solution just next beside our regular _main_ solution.

- Nice way to get all projects under one roof
- As I look at it, a global solution can be generated in two places
    - If there is a single more important repository -> generate it besides that
    - If all repositories are uniform -> create a new global repository
- For NUKE there is actually the nuke-build/nuke repository, which contains the code for the NuGet packages `Nuke.Common`, `Nuke.GlobalTool`, `Nuke.CodeGeneration`, and others
- So I'm generating a `nuke-global.sln` right beside the `nuke-common.sln`
- Due to this nature, I'm maintaining an `external/repositories.yml` file 

We haven't yet clarified, how exactly the global solution would **gain access to all the projects from foreign repositories**. I was never a fan of [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) after I've tried them almost a decade ago. A much simpler approach is to

- Previously, more repositories for NSwag, Docker, Azure CLI, Kubernetes etc.
- Right now, actually only nuke-build/resharper and nuke-build/visualstudio depend on `Nuke.Common`
- Inside my NUKE build, I've added a target `CheckoutExternalRepositories` that takes care of cloning the listed repositories

{%- include_relative 2019-12-12-multi-repository-projects/checkout-target.md -%}

The target reads the `repositories.yml` file (line 9), converts all entries to `GitRepository` objects (line 10). While iterating the repositories, the final directory is determined (line 14). Based on the `UseSSH` parameter (line 1), we chose either `https://github.com/` or `git@github.com` as `origin` endpoint (line 15). If the directory doesn't exist yet, we're cloning it to the previously determined directory (line 18). Note that we're also directly checking out the _default branch_ for the repository. However, if the directory was already cloned, we're just updating the `origin` to the new one (line 21-22).

## Converting References

In most situations, having all projects in a single global solution is not going to solve the maintenance issue completely. Since we're dealing with multiple repositories, several projects in different repositories might have dependencies on each other in the form of NuGet package references. As you may know, there are two types for referencing NuGet packages:

- Using a [packages.config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/packages-config) is the old and verbose way. Project files usually become very bloated. Also, it transitive dependencies are flattened out, so it's hard to deal with updates.
- Using a [PackageReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) item group has become the standard since the [SDK-based project files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/csproj) have been introduced. They mostly require just a single line to be added, make use of a common package cache by default, and are overall much more flexible to use.

I spent quite some time trying to find a way to conveniently **convert package references into project references**. Mostly, because there's also the requirement that the project file should _not_ be modified. That means, the original project file should stay intact, when I'm working on it via the local solution. Only when the project is used in our global solution, the reference types should be converted.

Take a deep breath in. There actually is a way using a `Directory.Build.targets` file to [customize our build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build). As a quick reminder, this file will be automatically included from the MSBuild engine when it's located in any parent directory to our project file. Your realize what that means? We can place this file _outside_ the other repositories into our repository containing the global solution. Send your thanksgivings to [Thomas Frenzel](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/1151#issuecomment-385133284) for this amazing approach:

To add a little bit of explanation:

|----------+-------------|
| Line(s)  | Explanation |
|:--------:|:------------|
| 6     | Defines the path to our global solution. The following logic is only applied when working in that particular solution. |
| 7     | Defines that by default all projects should have their package references replaced. We can individually opt-out by overriding in single project files. |
| 19-24 | Creates a new item group `SmartPackageReference` that knows whether the referenced package is available in the solution. |
| 26-31 | Creates another item group `PackageInSolution` based on the available packages and grabs their file paths. |
| 33-36 | Adds discovered projects as `ProjectReference` and removes them as `PackageReference`. |

**Known Limitations**

- `PackageId` must correspond to project name
